# 🧠 Data Science and Machine Learning

Welcome to my **Data Science and Machine Learning** repository!  
This is my personal learning space where I explore, practice, and implement practical concepts in **data science**, **machine learning**, and related areas.

---

## 📘 What’s Inside

- **Notebooks:** Hands-on Jupyter notebooks (and Google Colab versions) covering key topics like data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering  
- **Examples:** Small, focused code snippets to understand core concepts and algorithms  
- **Practice Problems:** Exercises and challenges to reinforce learning  
- **Projects:** Mini end-to-end projects applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets  

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- Data Analysis & Visualization  
- Statistics & Probability  
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Supervised & Unsupervised)  
- Feature Engineering & Model Evaluation  
- Deep Learning (Basics and Experiments)  
- Real-world Problem Solving

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Run Locally

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shafiqshams/data-science-and-machine-learning
```
2. Navigate into the project:
```bash
   cd data-science-and-machine-learning
``` 
3. Install dependencies (if required)
4. Open and run any specific notebook using VS Code or your preferred IDE/Jupyter environment
    

### Option 2: Use Google Colab

You can open and run any notebook directly in **Google Colab** without local setup.

1.  Click the **“Open in Colab”** badge at the top of each notebook _(if available)_
2.  Or upload the notebook manually to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3.  Make sure to mount Google Drive if the notebook requires dataset access
    

💡 Goal
-------

To build a strong foundation in data science and machine learning by learning through **implementation and experimentation**.
